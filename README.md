## Summary

Move the **upload video process** on YouTube to a CLI experience

## Upload Video Process Issues

The issue with the upload video is that the process takes too many steps. The upload video process is as such:

1. Create dance video
2. Log into youtube
3. Navigate to Creator Studio
4. Upload video
5. Set the appropiate settings (title, tags, privacy, unlisted ...)
6. etc...

It is quite a tedious process especially if you are backlogged by 2-5 videos and it is quite repetitive. So what is the solution?

## Solution

As someone who prefers the command line for my most of my processes, it would be nice to run a script that would look into my dedicated footage folder and upload the ones I have not been able to get to.
